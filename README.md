# LatinR 2024 Tutorial --  Working with larger than memory data in R with Arrow and DuckDB

This tutorial holds the dataset used for the tutorial. The dataset is small
sample of the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files
that has been prepared by Nic Crane, Jonathan Keane, and Neal Richardson for
their book "[Scaling Up With R and Arrow](https://arrowrbook.com/)". Many of the
code examples used in this tutorial have been inspired by the ones used in their
book.

## Content of the repository

* `code.R` is the file you can use to follow along with the talk
* `solutions.R` is the file for the code that used during the tutorial. It also
  includes a few extra practice exercises and answers to questions that were
  asked at the tutorial.

The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTLPVZWcJH-1e3KxMrIx14ab8KFTGL1pw2eQJDziEI3-8cyuvUxCkFFEXhJ9-YmnvbxTD4thiRt9QQF/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000) for the tutorial are available.
